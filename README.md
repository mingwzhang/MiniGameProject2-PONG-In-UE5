# Atari Pong Remake in Unreal Engine 5

Welcome to the Atari Pong Remake, a project developed as part of my learning process with Unreal Engine 5.

## Overview

This project is a remake of the classic Atari Pong game, originally released in 1972. The goal was to recreate the essence of the original game while leveraging the capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

## Game Engine

Unreal Engine 5 was used for the development of this project.

## Key Features

- **Design and Development:** All aspects of the game, including design, sound effects (SFX), art, and visual scripting, were created by me.
- **Blueprints:** This project served as my introduction to visual scripting using Blueprints in Unreal Engine.
- **Game Modes:** The game features two modes: One Player (Player vs. Computer) and Two Players (Player vs. Player).
